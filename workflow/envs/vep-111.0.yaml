# installing conda environment is not enough to have vep111 set up on your system
# you must run vep_install after activating the environment and set up caches and plugins manually
# some plugins require manual installation
# this workflow uses the homo_sapiens_merged/110_GrCh38 cache
# and the following plugins:
# AlphaMissense.pm, CADD.pm, Geno2MP.pm, gnomADc.pm, and SpliceAI.pm
# enformer, clinvar.hg38 (accessed 2024-09-09), gnomad genomes v.4.0
# dosae sensitivity, splicevault, and opentargets. All except clinvar and gnomad genomes
# can be accessed from the VEP Ensembl plugin page and must be installed manually
# update the config.yaml with accurate data and cache paths.
